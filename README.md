## Validation
### HTML Validation (Git Hash: "f9803fcd5fbd0eb9c35227b32ba9dbdbbf7f1855")
**"The element `label` must not appear as a descendant of the `a` element.":** This would require refactoring the label elements to something else. I chose span as another simple inline element.
*base.html -> lines 27, 35, 39, and 42*

**"An `img` element must have an `alt` attribute, except under certain conditions.":** This was an oversight. I chose the alt values of "snake preview" and "frogger preview" respectively.
*index.html -> lines 23, and 54*

**"Element `title` not allowed as child of element `header` in this context.":** This element was removed
*snake.html -> line 12*

**"Stray start/end tag `tr`, `td`, `th`":** These table elements have been generated by Django with `{{ score_form }}` and `{% csrf_token %}`. However, for each error indicating a "stray" openning tag by W3C, there is an associated error flagging the respective closing tag, also as "stray". So I have chosen to overlook this.
*game.html -> lines 40, and 41*

**" Attribute `name` not allowed on element `div` at this point.":** This attribute was added niavely to abide scroll snapping. It was removed at no effect to scroll snapping.
*game.html -> line 56*

**"Heading cannot be a child of another heading.", "End tag `div` seen, but there were open elements.", "Unclosed element `h1`." and "Empty heading.":** The `h1` element's closing tag lacked a backslash. This was ammended.
*frogger.html -> line 14*

**"The `name` attribute on the `img` element is obsolete. Use the `id` attribute instead.":** This was a misconception of the accessibility principles, and was altogether removed.
*signup.html -> line 17*

**"End tag `p` implied, but there were open elements." and "No `p` element in scope but a `p` end tag seen.":** These `p` elements have been generated by Django with `{% csrf_token %}` and `{{ form.as_p }}`. However, each error is the other's explicator.

**"End tag `p` implied, but there were open elements." and "No `p` element in scope but a `p` end tag seen.":** These `p` elements have been generated by Django with `{% csrf_token %}` and `{{ form.as_p }}`. However, each error is the other's explicator. So I have chosen to overlook this.
*signup.html -> lines 25, and 26*

**"Unclosed element `span`." and "Stray end tag `span`.":** As with the previous errors, I have interpretted these errors in Django's generated html as non-issues.
*signup.html -> lines 25, and 26*

### CSS Validation (Git Hash: "")
**"Value Error : padding-top `-12px` negative values are not allowed":** This was adjusted to `padding-bottom: 12px;`
*indexStyles.css -> line 17*

**"Due to their dynamic nature, CSS variables are currently not statically checked":** Here, I ammended my declared variables in `:root { ... }` of styles.css to accountStyles.css, gameStyles.css, and indexStyles.css.
